\begin{frame}{Point Algebra and ORD-Horn Subalgebra}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Point Algebra (PA)}:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 3 basic relations ($<$, $=$, $>$);
				\item $2^3 = 8$ total relations (basic relations plus $\leq$,$\geq$, $\not =$, $\top$ and the empty relation $\bot$);
				\item Consistency checking: $O(n^2)$ by van Beek algorithm;
			\end{itemize}
			
		\item \textbf{Interval Algebra (IA)}: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 13 basic relations ({\footnotesize \iab{}, \iabi{}, \iam{}, \iami{}, \iao{}, \iaoi{}, \iad{}, \iadi{}, \ias{}, \iasi{}, \iaf{}, \iafi{}, \iaeq{}});
				\item $2^{13}=8192$ total relations;
				\item Consistency checking: NP-complete;
			\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{ORD-Horn Subalgebra of IA}: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Unique maximal tractable subalgebra with all basic relations;
				\item each constraint can be converted in a set of disjunctions of PA-constraints;
				\item 868 total relations (included $\bot$ and $\top$);
				\item Consistency checking: $O(n^3)$ by PC, $O(c \cdot n)$ by \OHSAT{} [Gerevini, AIJ 2005].
			\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{\tlGraph{}}
	\begin{block}{\tlGraph{}}
		Graph $\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$ where each vertex in $V$ represents a CSP variable, each edge in $E$ represents a PA constraint in the CSP. Edges are either directed and labeled as \sQuote{$\leq$} or \sQuote{$<$}, or undirected and labeled as \sQuote{$\not =$}.

\begin{frame}{Static Algorithm for PA}

	\textbf{van Beek algorithm}:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item compute Strongly Connected Components (SCC) of the \tlGraph{} of CSP ignoring edges labeled \sQuote{$\not =$};
		\item return \dQuote{inconsistency} if it exists an edge labeled with either \sQuote{$<$} or \sQuote{$\not =$} s.t. both source and sink belongs to the same SCC; \dQuote{consistency} otherwise.
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{block}{Strongly Connected Component (SCC)}
		A Strongly Connected Components of a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ is a maximal set of vertices $C \subseteq V$ such that for every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ in $C$, we have both that $u$ reaches $v$ and $v$ reaches $u$.
