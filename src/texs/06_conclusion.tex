\begin{frame}{Conclusion and future works}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We have introduced the Decremental Consistency Checking for Temporal Constraints;
		\item finding a minimal set of constraints for relaxing an inconsistent CSP consistent is NP-hard;
		\item we propose and experimentally evaluate two new algorithms for CSPs over PA and over ORD-Horn; 
		\item the obtained performance gains over the static algorithms are significant;
		\item Future works include: decremental algorithms for spatial reasoning; an algorithm finding the minimal set of constraint relaxations making the temporal CSP consistent.
